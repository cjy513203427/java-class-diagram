# Java Class Diagram - Enhanced Edition

Generate interactive class diagrams for Java code using PlantUML with advanced Language Server integration.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### Enhanced Language Server Integration
- **Complete System Class Support**: Unlike traditional parsers, this extension leverages VSCode's Java Language Server to access complete information about JDK system classes, Maven dependencies, and project classes.
- **Real-time Class Resolution**: Automatically resolves inheritance hierarchies, interface implementations, and field relationships across your entire classpath.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Includes classes from external JAR files and Maven/Gradle dependencies in your diagrams.

### Interactive Class Diagrams
- **Click Navigation**: Click on any class in the diagram to jump directly to its source code, similar to VSCode's "Go to Definition" feature.
- **Method Navigation**: Navigate to specific methods within classes.
- **Zoom Controls**: Built-in zoom functionality with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + +/- for zoom, Ctrl/Cmd + 0 to reset).
- **Enhanced Styling**: Beautiful, modern styling inspired by intersystems-objectscript-class-diagram-view.
- **Full Package Names**: Displays complete package names in class titles (e.g., `com.webtutsplus.ecommerce.model.User`) without nested package structures, following the intersystems style.
